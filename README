# Project with Docker Image for Nginx and Custom index.html

This project contains a Docker image that includes the Nginx web server and uses a custom `index.html` file. 
The Docker image is built based on the official Nginx image.

## How to Use

1. Make sure you have Docker installed on your computer.

2. Clone the project repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/IsraSilver/Docker_With_Nginx

3. Navigate to the project directory:
  cd <project_directory>

4. Place your own index.html file in the root directory of the project.

5. Build the Docker image using the following command:

docker build -t dockerfile .

6. Run the container using the following command:

docker run -d -p 80:80 --restart=always your_image_name

The container will listen on port 80 on your host machine.

7. Open a web browser and visit http://localhost or http://your_host to view your index.html file.
